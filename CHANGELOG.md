## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-alpha.1]

### Fixed

- Component stylesheets now reach the consumer. In library mode Rollup strips
  `import "./Button.css"` out of the chunk and nothing puts it back, so
  0.1.0-alpha.0 shipped all 20 component stylesheets as emitted assets that no
  chunk imported and no `exports` entry named. Every component rendered
  unstyled and there was no supported way to load the rules: a consumer
  bundling `Button` got 4.52 kB of CSS (tokens only) where it should have got
  21.06 kB. The build now re-attaches each stylesheet to the chunk whose module
  imported it, so nothing changes at the call site.
- `check:pack` now fails on a packed stylesheet that no module imports and no
  `exports` entry names, and CI asserts that a component's rules land in the
  install fixture's own bundle. Both checks were green across the defect
  because each only asked whether advertised paths resolve, never whether a
  shipped file was reachable.

## [0.1.0-alpha.0]

### Added

- Repository bootstrap: build, type-check, lint, format, test, packed-artifact
  validation, and a clean external React install fixture.
- Apache-2.0 license and the initial public boundary rules.
